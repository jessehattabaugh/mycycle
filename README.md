# mycycle
My first cycle.js app

## How to start it
To start the dev server just
```
$ npm start
```
Watchers will automatically recompile code in /src, but you need a livereload browser plugin if you want the page to automatically refresh. I suggest [LivePage] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh)

## My Thoughts
I got hooked on Reactive programming while using Knockout. I loved how I could use Observables to wire up my Models and data would just flow wherever it needed to go. It beguiles me to no end that React isn't actually Reactive. VDOM sounds like a pretty good idea, but I don't like React's API. 

So I was pretty excited when I read about Cycle.js. Rx Observables sounded archaic and complicated compared to KO's Observables which are just getter/setter functions.
